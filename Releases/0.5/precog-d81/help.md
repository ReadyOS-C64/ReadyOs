# precog (d81)

- Release Line: `0.5`
- Artifact Build: `0.5W`
- Kind: `d81`

## Why This Variant Exists

- Main full-content ReadyOS profile: one D81 holds the current app catalog, ReadyBASIC modules, and examples.

## Artifacts

- Boot-time drive 8: `readyos-v0.5w-d81.d81`
- Host-Side Boot PRG: `readyos-v0.5w-d81-preboot.prg`
- Host-Side Boot PRG: `readyos-v0.5w-d81-boot.prg`

- Drive 8: `readyshell` - readyshell (beta) (portable; own REU overlays/state)
- Drive 8: `simplefiles` - simple files (portable; no separate app-owned REU workspace)
- Drive 8: `clipmgr` - clipboard (portable; shared REU clipboard/history)
- Drive 8: `readybasic` - ready basic (beta) (portable core; own REU core/code and buffers; USPEED/UMHZ require Ultimate)
- Drive 8: `cal26` - calendar 26 (portable; no separate app-owned REU workspace)
- Drive 8: `tasklist` - task list (portable; no separate app-owned REU workspace)

- Drive 8: `dizzy` - dizzy kanban (portable; no separate app-owned REU workspace)
- Drive 8: `readyirc` - readyirc (Ultimate-only TCP; own REU scrollback)
- Drive 8: `ucitest` - uci tester (Ultimate-only command lab; no separate app-owned REU workspace)
- Drive 8: `readme` - read.me (portable; no separate app-owned REU workspace)

All ReadyOS apps require the system REU for snapshots. The labels above distinguish additional app workspace from that baseline; shared clipboard operations also use REU. An Ultimate-only app can be present on portable media without becoming portable.
- ReadyBASIC example and module coverage is listed below from this profile's source configuration.
- ReadyBASIC's banked `rbcore`/`rbcode` resources are carried inside the `readybasic` executable rather than as separate disk files.

## ReadyBASIC examples and modules

This profile defines 44 BASIC example/test PRGs and 4 disk module packages: `rbm.sample1`, `rbm.sample2`, `rbm.sample3`, `rbm.media`.
Built-in graphics, immediate SID sound, MEMCAP and BORDER need no disk-module load. USPEED/UMHZ are built-in but require compatible Ultimate software turbo registers.
The new set includes RBSND07, RBGFXSNDDEMO and RBUGFXSNDDEMO. Use `ZMODLD("RBM.MEDIA",M%)` for eight on-demand music/image/sprite commands. Reserve with `MEMCAP(36864)` before strings/music; load images before starting music. The vetted PSID player is PAL-only. The standard demo avoids Ultimate speed calls; the Ultimate demo requires C64U Turbo Registers and uses 1 MHz during disk I/O.
In Orbital Echoes, Space restores the cached background, Q stops/releases music, and M keeps music playing at the text prompt. After M use `MUSDROP():CLR:MEMCAP(40960)` to release it.
The new disk-module/resource loaders read drive 8; they do not take a device argument. See the repository's `docs/readybasic_reference.md` (and HTML counterpart) for every example, command contracts and exact per-profile availability.

## Disk Directory Order

- Each image uses the groups it needs in this order: boot chain; configs; ordinary SEQ/USR data; main app PRGs; overlays/modules; REL data; ReadyBASIC examples.
- On bootable images, `PREBOOT` is the first directory entry, followed by any `SETD71` / `SHOWCFG`, then `BOOT` and `LAUNCHER`, so `LOAD"*",8` selects the bootstrap.
- ReadyShell overlay PRGs and ReadyBASIC `rbm.*` module packages stay in the overlay/module group even though their file types differ.
- Images that do not carry a category simply omit it without changing the relative order of the remaining categories.

## VICE Setup

- Enable REU with at least `1MB`; `8MB` or `16MB` is recommended where available.
- The host-side boot PRGs are convenience autostart files. The disk copy of `PREBOOT` is still the normal disk-side bootstrap.
- Configure drive 8 as `1581` with true drive enabled and attach `readyos-v0.5w-d81.d81`.

### VICE Command Example

- Autostart target: `readyos-v0.5w-d81-preboot.prg`

```sh
x64sc -reu -reusize 16384 -drive8type 1581 -drive8truedrive -devicebackend8 0 +busdevice8 -8 readyos-v0.5w-d81.d81 -autostart readyos-v0.5w-d81-preboot.prg
```

## Boot

- This profile uses the direct boot chain `PREBOOT -> BOOT`.
- There is no `SETD71` stage for this variant.
- Attach the single disk on drive `8`, then autostart `readyos-v0.5w-d81-preboot.prg` or run `LOAD "PREBOOT",8` then `RUN`.

## C64 Ultimate

- Copy the listed disk image files to the target storage.
- Enable the REU with at least `1MB`; use `8MB` or `16MB` where available.
- The host-side boot PRGs are optional convenience files for emulator launching; the disk-side `PREBOOT` entry is the standard hardware boot path.
- This profile compiles the portable launcher without Ultimate DOS DMA. Use `precog-ultimate` for the guided DMA-enabled D81, or explicitly override `LAUNCHER_DMA_LOAD=1` for development testing.
- Attach the single disk image on drive `8`, then boot with `LOAD "PREBOOT",8` and `RUN`.
- This variant boots directly from `PREBOOT` into `BOOT` and does not use `SETD71`.

## After PRECOG

PRECOG 0.5 is planned as the final PRECOG release: the series that established what is possible and clarified the vision. Next comes ReadyOS Ultimate, the main focus, installing/configuring real files and folders on Ultimate storage and using its hardware features; and ReadyOS Universal, continuing disk-image and REU workflows for VICE, THEC64 and original hardware. Universal effort will follow user interest and demand. These are future directions, not separate products shipped here. Standalone releases of many apps are also planned, including both apps with their own REU needs and apps without them. We remain committed to standalone ReadyBASIC independent of Ultimate and ReadyOS; this does not promise a no-REU interpreter. Current ReadyOS app PRGs still require the ReadyOS runtime.

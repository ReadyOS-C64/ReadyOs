# precog ultimate (dual d81)

- Release Line: `0.5`
- Artifact Build: `0.5`
- Kind: `ultimate`

## Why This Variant Exists

- C64 Ultimate D81 pair: drive 8 holds all apps, REL data, modules and media; drive 9 holds ReadyBASIC examples. DMA loading is enabled, with standalone SETUP for the drive-8 image path.

## Before You Boot

ReadyOS cannot discover which Ultimate host folder/image it was booted from: the mounted C64 drive does not provide the enclosing D81 host pathname. Ultimate DOS fast loading therefore needs the D81's absolute host path in `[launcher] c64u_image_path` in `apps.cfg`, together with `dma_loading=1`. SETUP browses Ultimate storage, validates the selected D81, and safely saves those settings inside it. Run SETUP again after moving or renaming the image. The normal disk loader remains the fallback.

## Artifacts

All ReadyOS apps require the system REU for snapshots. The labels above distinguish additional app workspace from that baseline; shared clipboard operations also use REU. An Ultimate-only app can be present on portable media without becoming portable.
- ReadyBASIC example and module coverage is listed below from this profile's source configuration.
- ReadyBASIC's banked `rbcore`/`rbcode` resources are carried inside the `readybasic` executable rather than as separate disk files.

## ReadyBASIC examples and modules

This profile defines 44 BASIC example/test PRGs and 4 disk module packages: `rbm.sample1`, `rbm.sample2`, `rbm.sample3`, `rbm.media`.
Built-in graphics, immediate SID sound, MEMCAP and BORDER need no disk-module load. USPEED/UMHZ are built-in but require compatible Ultimate software turbo registers.
The new set includes RBSND07, RBGFXSNDDEMO and RBUGFXSNDDEMO. Use `LDMOD("RBM.MEDIA",M%)` for eight on-demand music/image/sprite commands. Reserve with `MEMCAP(36864)` before strings/music; load images before starting music. The vetted PSID player is PAL-only. The standard demo avoids Ultimate speed calls; the Ultimate demo requires C64U Turbo Registers and uses 1 MHz during disk I/O.
In Orbital Echoes, Space restores the cached background, Q stops/releases music, and M keeps music playing at the text prompt. After M use `MUSDROP():CLR:MEMCAP(40960)` to release it.
The new disk-module/resource loaders read drive 8; they do not take a device argument. See the repository's `docs/readybasic_reference.md` (and HTML counterpart) for every example, command contracts and exact per-profile availability.

## Disk Directory Order

- Each image uses the groups it needs in this order: boot chain; configs; ordinary SEQ/USR data; main app PRGs; overlays/modules; REL data; ReadyBASIC examples.
- On bootable images, `PREBOOT` is the first directory entry, followed by any `SETD71` / `SHOWCFG`, then `BOOT` and `LAUNCHER`, so `LOAD"*",8` selects the bootstrap.
- ReadyShell overlay PRGs and ReadyBASIC `rbm.*` module packages stay in the overlay/module group even though their file types differ.
- Images that do not carry a category simply omit it without changing the relative order of the remaining categories.

## Validation Target

- This is an Ultimate-only SKU. VICE does not provide the Ultimate UCI/Ultimate DOS services SETUP requires, so VICE testing has no acceptance value for this variant.
- SETUP and DMA acceptance run on physical C64 Ultimate hardware at 1, 16, and 64 MHz.

## Boot

- This profile uses the direct boot chain `PREBOOT -> BOOT`.
- There is no `SETD71` stage for this variant.
- Attach all listed disks before boot, then autostart `readyos-v0.5-ultimate-preboot.prg` or run `LOAD "PREBOOT",8` then `RUN`.

## C64 Ultimate

- Copy the listed disk image files to the target storage.
- Enable the REU with at least `1MB`; use `8MB` or `16MB` where available.
- The host-side boot PRGs are optional convenience files for emulator launching; the disk-side `PREBOOT` entry is the standard hardware boot path.
- ReadyOS cannot discover which Ultimate host folder/image it was booted from: the mounted C64 drive does not provide the enclosing D81 host pathname. Ultimate DOS fast loading therefore needs the D81's absolute host path in `[launcher] c64u_image_path` in `apps.cfg`, together with `dma_loading=1`. SETUP browses Ultimate storage, validates the selected D81, and safely saves those settings inside it. Run SETUP again after moving or renaming the image. The normal disk loader remains the fallback.
- This SKU compiles the regular launcher with Ultimate DOS DMA support and ships `apps.cfg` with `dma_loading=1`; disk fallback remains active whenever DMA is unavailable.
- Mount the first D81 on drive `8` and the examples D81 on drive `9`. All apps, games, REL data, RBM packages and media assets remain on drive 8.
- Before the first ReadyOS boot, run `LOAD"SETUP",8,1`, then `RUN`, and configure the first (drive-8) D81 path.
- In ReadyBASIC, load examples from drive 9, for example `LOAD"RBUGFXSNDDEMO",9` then `RUN`. LDMOD and media commands continue reading their files from drive 8.
- SETUP is a standalone utility built from focused ReadyOS TUI micromodules. It checks REU, UCI, and Ultimate DOS, browses active Ultimate storage volumes/folders for D81 images, mounts the selection, validates its `apps.cfg`, and stages the exact host path into that image.
- SETUP uses F1/F3 for pages, cursor keys for selection, RETURN to enter/select, LEFT or DELETE to go to the parent, F5 to retest prerequisites, and F7 to apply a saved path or enter an absolute D81 path when none is available.
- After SETUP reports `CONFIGURED`, exit with RUN/STOP and reset or boot `PREBOOT`. Do not rename or move the D81 afterward without running SETUP again.
- Attach all listed disk images to their matching drives before boot, then run `LOAD "PREBOOT",8` and `RUN`.
- This variant boots directly from `PREBOOT` into `BOOT` and does not use `SETD71`.

## After PRECOG

PRECOG 0.5 is planned as the final PRECOG release: the series that established what is possible and clarified the vision. Next comes ReadyOS Ultimate, the main focus, installing/configuring real files and folders on Ultimate storage and using its hardware features; and ReadyOS Universal, continuing disk-image and REU workflows for VICE, THEC64 and original hardware. Universal effort will follow user interest and demand. These are future directions, not separate products shipped here. Standalone releases of many apps are also planned, including both apps with their own REU needs and apps without them. We remain committed to standalone ReadyBASIC independent of Ultimate and ReadyOS; this does not promise a no-REU interpreter. Current ReadyOS app PRGs still require the ReadyOS runtime.
